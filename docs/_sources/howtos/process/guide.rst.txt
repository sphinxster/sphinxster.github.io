Template Setup Guide
####################

Follow the instructions below to go from nothing to a robust documentation
framework hosted on GitHub, including an existing workflow for managing
community contributions that can scale with your project.

Overview
========
This documentation project is built on Sphinx, which relies on Python and
reStructuredText. It uses files and directories for content and strucutre to
generate a static HTML website. reStructuredText is a highly readable markup
language with powerful organizational and layout capabilities. 

Deploying this template for your Open Source project works best in a Linux
based operating system, though it can be done from Windows with a little
additional effort. At the very least, you will need a basic knowledge of Git
and the bash command line. You can find an introduction to Git and the
GitHub workflow that we use <here>.

This guide assumes that you have already received approval for your Open
Source project and that your Intel sponsored GitHub project exists. If not,
please see the prework below.

Setup Steps
===========
#. Set up a clean (empty) GitHub.com documentation repository.
#. Retrieve the document template as a zip file from https://github.intel.com/otc-tcs/documentation-template.
#. Extract document template to a directory and push it to your GitHub.com
   documenation repository: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/.
#. Create a directory called "website" at the same level where repository
   was extracted. This will be the target for the "make publish" command
   later. The final directory structure should look like this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      <projectname>/
         doc-source
         website

#. Set up a clean a new GitHub pages repository for your organization
   called: <projectname>.github.intel.com. Add a file called .nojekyll to
   top level of your GitHub pages repo rather than a "README.md" to make
   sure HTML is rendered correctly.
#. git clone the GitHub pages repository to your "website" directory.
#. Make sure the master branch of the github.io repo has github pages
   publishing enabled. There can be only one.
#. For detailed building and deployment instrucions go to :ref:`doc_gen`. 
#. TOC trees need to be in the index.rst at each level to define the
   site structure. For example, this is the TOC tree used to generate
   this site:

   .. code-block:: rest

      .. toctree::
         :maxdepth: 1

         introduction/index.rst
         getting_started/index.rst
         release_notes.rst
         howtos/index.rst
         contribute/index.rst

#. Changes to theme can be made by editing static/custom.css
#. No matter where the images are before the build, after the build all the
   images are collected in one directory: all the image filenames must be
   unique
#. Modify conf.py to reflect your project:
  
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      # General information about the project.
      project = u'<project name>'
      copyright = u'<year>, <project name>'
      author = u'<project name> developers'

#. Modify substitutions.txt to reflect your project:

   .. code-block:: rest

      .. |PN| replace:: <project name>

      .. |LPN| replace:: <long project name>

      .. _project repo: https://github.com/<projectname>/

      .. _documentation repo: https://github.com/<proejctname>/<docrepo>

      .. _documentation site: https://<projectname>.github.io

#. Make any edits to Makefile that might be needed to facilitate the build
   or change the name of your local instantiation of the github.io website
   repository directory
#. Replace logos and favicon in /images with your project logos
#. Run "make clean" to remove any previously generated HTML.
#. Regenerate the HTML with Sphinx: make html 
#. Push the updated content to the github.io repo: make publish
